# D2SHP

This tool converts Dune 2 format SHP sprites to a series of PCX images that can be processed by XCC Mixer or OS SHP Builder. I tried the Red Horizon converter but it produced an empty image, so I had to do it myself (sigh). I only intended this tool to be used to convert the C&C and RA1 mouse.shp files to the same SHP format as every other sprite in those games (sigh). Since I included the converted files in the repository, there is no further need for this tool.
